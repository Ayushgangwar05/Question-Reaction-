stateful:-a.It is used is class extend from react.
b.It is not having state.
c.In Stateful componets constructor can be used.
d.Stateful components having value.
e.stateful system are typically to build more complex to build and manage than stateless system.

stateless:-a. it is used in functional components pure j.s it can we rerender

<!-- What is UseState Hook ?(Implementation)?
a.useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.
b.useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:
1.The current state.
2.A function that updates the state.
Implementation:- a.we can import {usestate} from React
b.const[state,setstate]=usestate("")
c.state having a current value of usestate.
d.we can render value use setstate to render value of document -->

<!-- What is useEffect Hook ?(Implementation)?
a.The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
b.useEffect accepts two arguments. The second argument is optional.
1.<function>
    2.<dependency>
        Implementation:-a.we can import {useEffect} from react.
        b.In useEffect the component cannot rerender.Component can we render only onne time
        useEffect(()=>{

        },[0]) -->

<!-- What is UseReducer Hook ?(Implementation)?
a.UseReducer is similar to to usestate hook.
b.it is very usefull.
c.It allows for custom state logic.
d.it is used in place of usestate for multiple time or complex logic
Implementation:-a.Usereducer hook accept two argument.
1.reducer
2.initialState
b.impot {usereducer} from react.
c.const [data, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initstate);
we can write this function name(take some value){
let action={}
}
d.usereducer having dispatch also in dispatch they take action value.
e.the reducer take value of two argument(currstate.,action){

} -->

<!-- What is UseMemo Hook ?(Implementation)?
a.The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
b.The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
Implementation:-a.import {useMemo} from react. -->
